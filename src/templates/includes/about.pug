          h3.about__text_title Our mission
          p.about__main At ChronoBank.io, we are challenging the status quo and bringing an alternative to traditional financial systems.
          p This alternative is a new generation of time-based currencies utilising the latest developments in blockchain technology.
          p Despite soaring interest in distributed ledger technology, there are currently very few blockchain apps poised for mainstream market adoption.
          p ChronoBank.io has been designed by a consortium of professionals with over 100 years of combined recruitment experience, in consultation with experts who can create the software to leverage blockchain technology to solve real-world business problems.
          p Specifically, we want to create a revolution in short-term recruitment within key professions.

          .about__legend We created the financial backbone of ChronoBank.io: National Labour–Hour (LH) tokens
        .about__text
          h3.about__text_title Labour–Hour Stable Coins
          p.about__text_main Labour-Hour tokens are linked to average hourly wages in the host country and are backed by a real labour force from big recruitment and labour-hire companies.
          p Labour is abundant enough for everyone to have access to it, yet scarce enough to be valuable. It is the most tradeable resource in the real economy.
          p LH tokens will tokenise this resource. Because they are backed by real labour, they are absolutely inflation-proof and have next to zero volatility — in comparison to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
          p This solution is far more sustainable than any of the fiat-pegged or backed coins that currently exist in the crypto market. LH tokens will be hyper-liquid and accessible 24/7 via the LH debit card.
