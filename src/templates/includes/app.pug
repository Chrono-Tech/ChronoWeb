            p #[b LH tokens will act as a substitute for payments in fiat currencies] and will enable people to be rewarded for their work – without cryptocurrency’s signature volatility risk.
            p.app__hidden We have taken great care to design the system for ease of use, to make sure that actual labour time and the LH token can be exchanged efficiently for each other. While timebanking in its simplest form uses a standard exchange rate for time, each ChronoBank.io participant will have reputation assigned to them, to enable them to access remuneration appropriate to their skill level.
            p The better the individual’s reputation based on previous work, the higher the price they will be able to command for an hour’s work. #[b Initial reputation will be set based on the individual’s experience within the partner company from stage one of the project.]
            p.app__hidden For those who have not participated in the system in any previous capacity, a nominal average reputation will be assigned. #[br] Every care is taken to incentivise the user to increase their reputation and maintain it at the highest level.
